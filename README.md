The Web-Based Online Examination System aims to streamline the evaluation process by automating it entirely, ensuring efficiency and accuracy. Colleges can register and manage their institutions, staff, and students within the system. Staff members can conduct exams using viva or optional modes. Viva mode enables face-to-face video conferencing, while the optional mode employs face recognition to identify students.
